data-yaml

Haskell experiments using the yaml package (Data.Yaml library)

installing yaml installs json2yaml and yaml2json

$ c yaml2json test.yml 
{"weight":123,"name":"joe"}

$ c yaml2json test2.yml 
{"weight":"123","name":"joe"}


$ json2yaml < test.json
---
weight: 123
name: joe


$ json2yaml < test2.json
---
weight: '123'
name: joe
